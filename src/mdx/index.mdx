    Hi there!
    <PrideFlag />
  </p>

<p className="text-lg">
  I make things go beep boop. This site serves as a placeholder for some of my
  web dev practice, as well as any projects I intend to showcase.
</p>

<p className="my-2 text-lg">
  I am mostly a self-taught developer. Thanks to many open source libraries, I
  am able to experiment and tinker around with things that pique my interest.
</p>

<p className="my-2 text-lg">
  Most of what you see will probably be barren or otherwise works in progress,
  but feel free to look around!
